ðŸŽ¬ My Movie Review API Project
What This Project Is About
This is a backend API I built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). My main goal was to create a web service that lets people manage movie reviews. This project was a big challenge, but it taught me a ton about databases, API design, and user security.

I'm really proud of how it turned out! It's a full-fledged API that's ready to be connected to a website or mobile app.

âœ¨ What I Can Do
I managed to build all the key features from my plan. Here's a quick rundown of what the API can do:

Secure User Logins: You have to register and log in to get a special token. This token is like a key that lets you do things like create or edit reviews.

Permissions: I made sure you can only change or delete a review that you wrote yourself. This keeps everything safe and secure!

Movie & Review Management: You can create, read, update, and delete both movies and reviews. This is the main "CRUD" part of the project.

Standard API Endpoints: I tried my best to use standard URLs and methods, so other developers can understand and use my API easily.

ðŸš€ How to Get It Running
If you want to run this project on your own computer, just follow these steps.

Clone the project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/nahoomg/movie-review-api
cd movie-review-api-capstone

Note: Please be sure to replace your-username with my actual GitHub username.

Set up your virtual environment:

py -m venv env
# To activate on Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
# To activate on macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

Install all the stuff I used:

pip install djangorestframework

Set up the database:

py manage.py migrate

Create an admin user:

py manage.py createsuperuser

This lets you log in to the Django admin site to see all the data.

Start the server!

py manage.py runserver

The API will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can see the main list of endpoints at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/.

ðŸ§ª How to Test It Out
You can use a tool like Postman or the API's browsable interface in your web browser to test all the features. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Step 1: User Authentication
Register a new user:

Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/register/

Send a POST request with this data:

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

What you'll get back: A unique token that you'll use for all other actions!

Step 2: Create a Movie
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/movies/

Send a POST request with this data:

{
  "title": "Inception",
  "description": "A dream within a dream.",
  "release_date": "2010-07-16",
  "genre": "Sci-Fi"
}

What you'll get back: The details of the new movie.

Step 3: Create a Review
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/reviews/

Add your token: You need to put the token from Step 1 in your request. Look for the "Authorization" header and set the value to Token your_token_here.

Send a POST request with this data:

{
  "movie": 1, 
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Amazing movie!"
}

Note: The "movie": 1 refers to the id of the movie you created in the last step. The API knows who you are from your token, so you don't need to specify a user ID!

This is just a little bit of what the API can do. I hope you enjoy checking it out!
