My Movie Review API Project
What This Project Is About 
This is a backend project I'm building to learn how to create an API. It's an API for a movie review website. It lets you:

Create, view, and delete movies.

Create, view, update, and delete reviews for those movies.

Manage users and their reviews.

I'm using Django and Django REST Framework to build it, and it's my final project for my backend development course!

How to Get It Running 
If you want to run this on your computer, just follow these steps:

Clone the project

Bash

git clone https://github.com/nahoomg/movie-review-api-capstone.git
cd movie-review-api-capstone
Install the things you need

Bash

# I'm using a virtual environment, you should too!
py -m venv env
# To activate it on Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
# Or on Mac/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

# This installs Django and Django REST Framework
pip install djangorestframework
Set up the database

Bash

py manage.py migrate
Create an admin user

Bash

py manage.py createsuperuser
This lets you use the admin site to see your database tables.

Run the server!

Bash

py manage.py runserver
Now you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ in your browser to see the API.

What's Next? 
I still have a lot more to do! My next steps are:

Add more features, like user authentication.

Make sure you can only edit reviews you wrote.

Deploy it to a live website like Heroku.
